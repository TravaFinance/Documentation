TRAVA FINANCE is the worldâ€™s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. Different from existing approaches, we offer a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA FINANCE also brings to you the credit score function based on financial data on-chain analysis, which is a useful tool to reduce risk and increase profits for all users. We have started integrating AI technology to our products with the ultimate goal of giving users the best experience on Web3 and with DeFi space.

We build our solutions on TRAVA.FINANCE whose smart contracts are deployed on the BSC network, so the speed of transactions, gas fees, and robustness depend on the BSC network. However, in the near future, we will allow cross-chain lending on our platform.
