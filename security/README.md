# Security

## Introduction

The concept of decentralised finance (DeFi) is leading the change in the way we conduct our finances across the globe. Simultaneously, like any new advancement, there are always challenges and there is room for security improvement. When it comes to Trava, we prioritize security as a fundamental principle of our proposal  to eliminate potential risks from cybercrime. With the aim of ensuring the best experience and maximizing benefits to users, we decided to collaborate with Certik and Hacken, two of the leading firms in auditing, to make sure that the protocol matches the highest security standards.
