# Conclusion

To summarize, the TRAVA ecosystem has thoroughly been audited by Certik and Hacken. Nevertheless, the Trava team always strives to improve our platform for better security with the three-layer security strategy (Internal, External, and Community Standard).

Apart from getting audited by these firms, Trava will continue to have the audit with other third-party auditors throughout the proposalâ€™s lifetime to day by day enhance the quality of our product for the sake of users.
