## How to join Trava Pottery

### Trava Pottery Entrance

Visit the main site of Trava Pottery: [https://pottery.trava.finance/](https://pottery.trava.finance/)

You will be reminded to connect your wallet if you haven’t. You can select and authorize the wallet you want depending on your preferences, but make sure that it has a BAB token. BAB is a non-transferable token with no monetary value – its main use is to prove that the owner of the wallet has verified their identity. You can check how to mint BAB tokens [here](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/how-to-mint-binance-account-bound-bab-token-bacaf9595b52440ea2b023195ba4a09c).

### Referral system

Basically, its mechanism is that those who invite friends and the friends themselves will receive a reward distributed from the referral fund, which is 10% of the total reward. In addition, the number of referees will have an impact on the percentage of rewards you can claim from the vesting pool, which has been discussed in the previous section.

#### Referring friends

Click the “Create code” button on your Profile page, and you will be asked for a gas fee to continue (this is just an example if you use Metamask).

After that you can send the code to your friends – these referees will bring you additional rewards and some other benefits. When they use your code, your friends will appear in the referral list:
