# Transmutation



Transmutation allows Knights owners to easily transmute 2 Trava Amoury NFTs, which are the same rarity and type, to get another type of item in the same rarity.

Notes:

* After the Transmutation, the EXP of the new item will be calculated as the average of the two Trava armoury items transmuted.
* A certain amount of time is required to do transmutation.
* Those transmuting their items need to pay a small fee in  $TRAVA, which depends on the rarity of each item.
* Unlike the trade-up mechanism, in Transmutation, there is no failure rate which means users can always transmute their items successfully.

Check the detailed information about transmutation time and fee in the following table:  &#x20;

|                  |            |            |          |             |             |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Rarity**       | **Copper** | **Silver** | **Gold** | **Diamond** | **Crystal** |
| **Forgery time** | 2 hours    | 4 hours    | 8 hours  | 16 hours    | 32 hours    |
| **Fee**          | 200        | 500        | 1250     | 3500        | 25000       |

Where,

* Forgery time: The period it takes to transmute the armoury item.
* Fee: An transmutation fee of Trava Knights need to pay

For example, you transmute one diamond Shield with 100,000 EXP and one diamond Shield with 50,000 EXP to get a diamond Weapon. In this case, the Trava Knights need to pay 5000 $TRAVA and wait for 16 hours to obtain the new item. The EXP for the newly transmuted is calculated as follows:

$$
EXP = \frac{100000+50000} {2} = 75000 (points)
$$
