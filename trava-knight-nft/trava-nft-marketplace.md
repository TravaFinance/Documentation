# Trava NFT Marketplace

We implemented a NFT marketplace to give users a platform to exchange Knights, Items, etc. Preliminary process:

* **Sellers:** list their Trava Armoury NFTs and Knight NFTs on our Marketplace.
* **Buyers:** buy item(s) at a price listed by the seller.

## **Buy Order**

We implemented a new feature that allows users to order Knights, Items they need on our NFT Marketplace with simple steps:

* Going to NFT Marketplace (Buy Order section)
* Creating a purchase order with specific features: Rarity, Type, Exp point, Price,v.v)

Notes that:

* The prices must be set at a fixed price
* EXP is at the lowest point that the buyers accept to buy
