1. **Reward:** To incentivise users to provide liquidity to pools, pool owners can set up rewards paid in TRAVA token.
2. 2.**Collateral and lending:** TRAVA tokens may be used as the basic collateral for loans and mortgages.
3. 3.**Payment for lending fees:** As the native platform currency, TRAVA tokens may be used to pay for lending fees in TRAVA.FINANCE pools.
4. 4.**Payment for pool management:** As the native platform currency, TRAVA tokens may be used by pool owners to pay for pool management by TRAVA.FINANCE.
5. 5.**Payment for auction deposits:** In the NFT auction process, TRAVA tokens can be used as the deposit for purchase transactions.
6. 6.**Payment for auction organization:** The NFT’s owners (auction organizers) may pay for auction fees with TRAVA tokens.
7. 7.**Staking for a validator:** The data stored on the knowledge graph chain must be verified by validators. As an indication of commitment and service standard assurance, validators would be required to put up an amount of Trava token as a security deposit (i.e. a "stake") before being entitled to participate in the ecosystem. Where validators commit offences (e.g. incorrect information, unacceptable down-time, or other malicious acts), this stake may be slashed.
8. 8.**Staking to participate in the governance process:** The Trava token would allow holders to create and vote on on-chain governance proposals to determine future features of TRAVA.FINANCE, with voting weight calculated in proportion to the tokens staked (the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of TRAVA.FINANCE; it does not entitle Trava token holders to vote on the operation and management of the Company, its affiliates, or their assets or the disposition of such assets to token holders, or select the board of directors of these entities, or determine the development direction of these entities, does not constitute any equity interest in any of these entities or any collective investment scheme; the arrangement is not intended to be any form of joint venture or partnership).
