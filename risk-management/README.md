# Risk Management

## Introduction

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has flourished in this day and age with billions of locked assets. As being the worldâ€™s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending, Trava has been forming adequate standards to manage the risks emerging from the hyper-connected ecosystem.&#x20;

The following documentation illustrates the protocol parameters for the purpose of alleviating the fundamental risks that may arise. These are the parameters defined when creating the Pool such as borrowing/lending interest rate, liquidity threshold, Loan to Value ratio, Health Factor, Liquidation penalty, and Reserve Factor. These parameters are of paramount importance to users when participating in Pool operations.&#x20;

Pool parameters are divided into two groups: interest rate parameters and risk parameters.
